# Floor It !

A lonely hero, lawless cowboys, killing machines, ... Embark on a synthwave journey to Los Angeles alongside our mysterious driver and his robots companions ... but beware to not be sacrified !
In this world, "Neon" is scarce, and your old trustworthy neon powered car won't move on it's own ! Better hope to not be the one scraped away in order to start the engine !

## Gameplay

The gameplay is a rotation between a Shoot'Em Up phase, a gestion phase, and a textual phase where you have decisions to take. The core of the game is composed of 5 levels, and in order to start one level you have to spend one currency named "Neon". 

## The Neon

The Neon is the one and only currency in the game. There is 2 ways to obtain Neon : either with the textual events, or by scraping your car/your robots. That's where the notion of sacrifice comes up. Sometimes, if you're not lucky enough, you'll HAVE to give up on one of your travel mate (that means losing their damages and skill). Then again, Neon is more than just the currency you need to start a level, it is also the currency you need to repair your car (that means regaining your hp !).

## How to play

Here are the keys you need to know :
- WASD or ZQSD to move your car (during the Shoot'Em Up phases)
